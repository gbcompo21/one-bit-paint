# One Bit Paint

This is a fun project that I made for the [Game Boy Competition 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gbcompo21)

I don't know if I'll improve this ROM in the future, but collaborations are more than welcome!

## How to run
Simply download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/pedroafabri/one-bit-paint/releases/tag/latest) and run it in any GameBoy emulator.

## Compiling
You need the GBDK installed in your PATH, then execute the `build.sh` script.
